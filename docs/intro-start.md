Sonar can run on any computer running Linux, Windows, or macOS. It can run on servers, personal computers and tiny machines like a Raspberry Pi.

We intend to provide packages and installers soon. Currently, you need git and NodeJS to try out Sonar.

*Note: Sonar is still alpha software and currently not yet easily usable for end users*

**See the [README of sonar](https://github.com/arso-project/sonar) for how to setup a development version of Sonar.**
